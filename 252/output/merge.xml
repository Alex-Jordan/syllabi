      <p>
                PCC wants you to be successful and have resources that may help.
                If you face challenges affording food or housing, or if you need access to technology,
                this will naturally affect your classwork.

      <title>Expectations</title>
      <p>
        This term we are responding to the coronavirus pandemic.
        The physcial buildings at PCC are closed, and we cannot conduct the usual face-to-face instruction that we are all used to
        (both as students and as instructors).
    </p>
      <p>
        We all have extra responsibilities this term. As the instructor, I need to find new ways to deliver the instruction to you at home.
        I need to be creative and flexible with how we use technology. And you, the student, need to have the self-discipline to complete
        everything that I ask of you. And also to be brave and bring all of your concerns and questions to me as soon as you can.
    </p>
      <p>
        We can boil down your responsibilities to the following list.
        <ul><li>
                <p>
                    Sign in to the live sessions we will have in Zoom every Monday and Wednesday at 9:00.
                    I will give a brief overview of the important points of the day, and I will take your questions,
                    including questions you have about examples and exercises.
                    Then we will usually move to the lab portion of the class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have to miss all or part of a class session, watch the recording of the overview portion.
                </p>
            </li><li>
                <p>
                    Collaborate with your lab partners on the lab assignments during our live sessions.
                    <em>When needed</em>, continue to collaborate with your lab partners outside of class.
                    Your lab group must complete write-ups of each lab by its due date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have to miss a lab session, complete the lab on your own by its due date.
                </p>
            </li><li>
                <p>
                    Read sections of the <url href="http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~fitzpat/apex-calculus/">textbook</url> <em>ahead</em> of class.
                    We will not be using class time to demonstrate examples,
                    which is common in an in-person classroom setting. It would not be the best use of our time.
                </p>
            </li><li>
                <p>
                    Watch the videos that are embedded in the version of the <url href="http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~fitzpat/apex-calculus/">textbook</url>
                    that I am directing you to. My colleague at University of Lethbridge produced these videos
                    and they were made for our book specifically.
                </p>
            </li><li>
                <p>
                    Complete the homework exercises that are assigned in <webwork/>.
                    There will be a problem set associated to each section of the textbook that we cover.
                </p>
            </li><li>
                <p>
                    Complete the weekly quiz that is assigned in <webwork/>.
                    Each quiz is timed, and uses the questions from homework where the class had the least amount of success.
                    This is intended to motivate you to do all of the homework and ask questions when you do not understand something yet.
                </p>
            </li><li>
                <p>
                    Use all the tools available to you to communicate with me about your concerns and your questions.
                    <ul><li>Direct Email</li><li>D2L Discussion Posts (can be posted anonymously)</li><li>Raising issues during the Zoom sessions</li><li>Schedule one-on-one Zoom meeting with me</li></ul>

      <title>Technology Requirements</title>
      <p>
    	Since we are in a remote teaching mode, it is essential that you have access to a computer, laptop, tablet, or at the very least a smart phone.
    	And you need internet access. Ideally, your device and internet connection will work with the Zoom sessions,
    	but otherwise you can call in to the Zoom meetings. You do not need to purchase or install Zoom.
    </p>
      <p>
    	We will be using Google Docs for the labs and lab write-ups. As a PCC student, you have access to Google Docs.
    	Typically I will simply send you a link to a Google Doc as needed. You may access all of your Google Docs by using PCC Gmail,
    	and using the 3<times/>3 icon in the upper right.
    </p>
      <p>
    	Homework and quizzes use <webwork/>. You log in to your <webwork/> account using a web browser.

      General PCC Grading Guidelines are found at

        <title>Labs</title>
        <p>
      Most class days, you will work in small groups on a collection of exercises
      from the <url href="https://spot.pcc.edu/math/clm/">PCC Calculus Lab Manual</url>.
      Work on these diligently during class time with your partners,
      and then turn in a completed lab write-up. You and your partners might finish during class,
      but you may need to arrange to meet with each other after class.
      You need to complete each lab write-up before the next class meets.
    </p>
        <p>
      If you miss class, you may complete the lab on your own and turn it in before the next class.
    </p>
        <p>
      One grade will be assigned for each lab write-up. All group memebers share the grade.
      Each lab write-up is worth 2% of your final grade, for a total of 28%.
    </p>
      </paragraphs>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Online Homework</title>
        <p>
      You have online homework for each section using <webwork/>. See <xref ref="section-webwork" text="title"/> for details.
      The due date for each assignment is posted in <webwork/>.
      It will always be Tuesday evening at 10:00pm. Usually, more than one section will be due at the same time.
      You should start working on a homework assignment soon after the class that is associated with that section of APEX.
    </p>
        <p>
      Collectively, all the online homework is worth 6% of your final grade.
    </p>
      </paragraphs>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Quizzes</title>
        <p>
      You have weekly quizzes using <webwork/>.
      Each <webwork/> <em>homework</em> assignment is due on a Tuesday evening.
      I will build a quiz that uses those homework questions for which there was the least overall success,
      but still appropriate for a 1-hour time limit.
      This is intended to motivate you to do all of the homework and ask questions when you do not understand something yet.
      You take these quizzes when you are able to, but they must be completed by Friday evening at 10:00pm.
      Each quiz is worth 2% and there are 8 quizzes, for a total of 16%.
    </p>
        <!-- <p>
      See <xref ref="section-webwork" text="title"/> for details.
      The due date for each assignment is posted in <webwork/>. Generally when a topic is on our course calendar,
      the online homework is due the following Wednesday evening.
      You should start working on it soon after the class that works on that topic, ideally on the same day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Collectively, all the online homework is worth 10% of your final grade.

    <title>Written Assignments</title>
      <p>
        In the last third of the course, your homework includes some exercises where you must write up something on paper.
        Turn these in on the days they are due.
        Each written assignment is worth 2% of your grade for a total of 6%.
        See <xref text="title" ref="section-written-assignments"/> for the specifics.

        <title>Exams</title>
        <p>
      The final exam will be Monday June 8. Hopefully it will be on campus, in our classroom TH 200, 9:00<ndash/>11:50.
      At this time we can't be sure. The final exam will be worth 25% of your grade.
    </p>
        <p>
      There will also be a midterm exam. Because of the virus response, its format and location are not yet known.
      Tentatively, it will be an in-person exam in our classroom TH 200, 9:00<ndash/>11:50, on Wednesday May 6.
      The midterm will be worth 25% of your grade.

    <title>Optional Class Prep Assignments</title>
    <p>
      This is an opportunity to reduce the weight of the exams down to just 21%, 21%, and 22%,
      padding your grade with some work that is easy to do if you budget time for it.
      At the same time, it wil get you to engage more fully with the material and it should ultimately
      help you do better on the exams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each class day, you could come to class having <em>already</em> watched the video lessons for the day's section.
      As you watch the videos, there are video lecture notes that you could complete.
      Bringing these notes to me on the class day counts as proof that you watch the videos and engaged with them.
      For each section, I will record that you watched the videos and took notes, which credits you with 0.5% toward your grade,
      reducing the corresponding exam weight by 0.5%.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you miss class, you may scan/photo your work and send it to me electronically before the end of the day it is due.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may find the videos and the video lecture notes on the <xref ref="section-calendar" text="title"/>.
      In class on the first day, we will discuss more how this works.

      <p>
    I have made an account for you on a program called <webwork/> at
    <url href="https://webwork.pcc.edu/webwork2/mth251-jordan-202002/">webwork.pcc.edu/webwork2/mth251-jordan-202002</url>.
    Each week there are problem sets and you are required to answer them online using <webwork/>.
    The topics that we cover in a week have exercises that are typically due Tuesday of the following week
    at 10:00<nbsp/><pm/>, but can be worked on much earlier.
    You may submit answers any time before the due date. You may work from home or use PCC computer labs to turn in your answers.
  </p>
      <p>
    Here is an example of what a <webwork/> problem is like.

        <title>Why are we using WeBWorK?</title>
        <p>
      Traditionally, homework comes from textbook problems that students would do on paper, and then turn in in to the instructor.
      One drawback of this is that students get no feedback at all until about a week later,
      and at that point the student is no longer actively thinking about material from two weeks earlier.
      Another drawback is that it is impossible for a student to do the appropriate amount of homework
      and for the instructor to give quality feedback for every single exercise.
      Often an instructor is only able to give feedback for a small subset of the exercises.
      Using <webwork/> brings the following advantages over traditional homework.
    </p>
        <p>
      <dl><li>
          <title>Cost</title>
          <p>
            <webwork/> is free, unlike many online homework programs.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <title>Timely Feedback</title>
          <p>
            Rather than waiting a week for written feedback from your instructor, you get instant feedback from <webwork/>.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <title>Quality Feedback</title>
          <p>
            <webwork/> will do more than just tell you if you are right or wrong.

    or even on which days. It is possible there will be an in-person midterm on Wednesday May 6,
    and an in-person final exam on Monday June 8. If they are in-person, they will be in TH 200, 9:00<ndash/>11:50.

      If you miss an exam, you must contact me within one day to explain why
      or I might not be able to allow a make-up and you would receive a zero.
      <alert>Make-up exams are only permitted under extreme circumstances.
      PCC does not have enough staff and facilities to administer too many make-up exams.</alert>
      If you have a valid excuse, you must make up the exam within the next two business days,
      or I might not be able to allow a make-up and you would receive a zero.
      If you are going to make up the exam, contact the testing center immediately
      (<url href="http://www.pcc.edu/resources/testing/proctored/">www.pcc.edu/resources/testing/proctored</url>)
      to learn what time you might be able to make up the exam.
