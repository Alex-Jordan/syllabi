  <title>WeBWorK Assignments</title>

  <p>
    I have made an account for you on a program called <webwork/>
    that you will access through D2L.
    Each week there are problem sets and you are required to answer them online using <webwork/>.
    The topics that we cover in a week have exercises that are typically due Monday of the following week
    at 10:00<pm/>, but can be worked on much earlier.
    You may submit answers any time before the due date.

    <title>Why are we using WeBWorK?</title>

    <p>
      Traditionally, homework comes from textbook problems that students would do on paper,
      and then turn in in to the instructor.
      One drawback of this is that students get no feedback at all until up to a week later,
      and at that point the student may be no longer actively thinking about material from two weeks ago.
      Another issue is that it is not possible for a student to do the appropriate amount of homework
      and for the instructor to give quality feedback for every single exercise.
      Often an instructor is only able to give feedback for a small subset of the exercises.
      Using <webwork/> brings the following advantages over traditional homework.
    </p>

      <dl>
        <li>
          <title>Cost</title>
          <p>
            <webwork/> is free, unlike many online homework programs.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Timely Feedback</title>
          <p>
            Rather than waiting a week for written feedback from your instructor, you get instant feedback from <webwork/>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Quality Feedback</title>
          <p>
            <webwork/> will do more than just tell you if you are right or wrong.
            For example, it will usually tell you if you haven't completely simplified an answer
            or forgot to include units when they are required. Sometimes it will do even more.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Ease of Communication</title>
          <p>
            <webwork/> encourages you to write your instructor for help,
            who can provide even higher quality feedback based on your message and your previous attempts.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Multiple or Unlimited Attempts</title>
          <p>
            On paper, when you submit an answer, that's the end of it.
            With <webwork/> you might get a problem wrong on your first attempt,
            but you are encouraged to figure out your mistakes and try again.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Efficient Use of Class Time</title>
          <p>
            Your instructor can monitor the whole class and see in real-time
            which problems and concepts are causing the class difficulty.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Extra Practice</title>
          <p>
            Your instructor can set things up so that you can retry each problem with new random numbers involved.
            If you are unsure if you have mastered a skill, this gives you a way to keep practicing.

    <title>Homework Sets Menu</title>
    <p>This shows you the assignments that have been assigned to you and when they are due. You may:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            click on an assignment and begin working on problems online
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            check the box next to an assignment and click <c>Download Hardcopy</c> to get the assignment as a <c>.pdf</c> file
            which you may then print to work on away from a computer.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      When you click on an assignment, you will see a screen with the problem numbers listed.
      Off to the right is a message for you that might have specific instructions or information about the assignment.
      You should always look for and read this message.
    </p>

    <title>Emailing for Help</title>
    <p>
      When you are stumped, you can click the <c>Email Instructor</c> button at the bottom of any problem.
      Write a message explaining what you have tried and if possible, include the work from your calculations.
      <webwork/> will send your instructor an email with helpful information (like all of the incorrect attempts you have tried)
      and they get back to you soon with a response. When they respond, it will be with an email,
      so <alert>you must remember to check your email</alert>.

    <title>Math Achievements</title>
    <p>
      As you complete more problems through the term, you will win badges for various <q>achievements</q>.
      For example, the <q>On One Hand</q> badge is for completing a homework set with fewer than five incorrect submissions.
      Both earning badges and just plain answering questions correctly will earn you <q>achievement points</q>.
      As you gain more achievement points, you will level up.
      Each time you level up, you earn an item that can be used to affect your grade.
