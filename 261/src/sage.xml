    <title>Sage Examples</title>

    <p>Here are some Sage cells where you can do certain things that you cannot do so easily with a graphing calculator. Throughout the term I will add Sage examples from class here.</p>

    <paragraphs>
        <title>Solve a Linear System</title>
        <p>Note the doulbe equals sign for making a comparison. Also note that multiplications must be explicit: <c>2*x</c>, not merely <c>2x</c>.</p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                var('x y z')
                solve([x+y+z==1,2*x-y+z==2,3*x+3*y+z==1],x,y,z)
            </input>
        </sage>
    </paragraphs>

    <paragraphs>
        <title>Row Reduce Matrices</title>
        <p>First you must have a line that defines what kind of matrices you will work with. The <c>QQ</c> stands for the rational numbers, so these matrices will accept rational numbers as entries. You see <c>2</c> and <c>3</c> because we will make a <m>2\times3</m> matrix. The <c>echelon_form()</c> command gives reduced row echelon form.</p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                M = MatrixSpace(QQ, 2, 3)
                A = M([1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4])
                A.echelon_form()
            </input>
        </sage>
    </paragraphs>
