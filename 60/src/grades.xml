        <title>Class Prep Assignments</title>
        <p>Most class days you are supposed to come to class with a class prep assignment completed. You'll turn these in when you come into class. Then while you work on some warm-up exercises, I will look over your prep assignments and give you credit for them. Each one is worth 0.5% of your grade. There are 15 of these total, so all together they are worth 7.5% of your grade</p>

        <p>If you miss class, you may scan/photo your work and send it to me electronically before the end of the day it is due.</p>

        <title>In-class Group Work</title>
        <p>Most class days, you will work in small groups on a collection of exercises that go along with the lesson you prepared for. If you work on these diligently during class time with your partners, you will get credit for 0.5% of your final grade for each one (even if your group is not able to finish these in time). There are 17 of these, so in total these are worth 8.5% of your grade.</p>

        <p>If you miss class, you may bring a <em>fully completed</em> activity to me within one week and still get the 0.5% credit. It must be fully completed, not partially completed. The work must be shown, not just the answers.</p>

        <p>Blank group activities are available for download at the <xref ref="section-calendar" text="title"/>. The day after each one is due, a version with answers will also be posted there. It will just have simple answers, not fully worked out explanations of how to get those answers.</p>
    </paragraphs>

    <paragraphs>
        <title>Online Homework</title>
        <p>You have online homework for each section using Edfinity (a front end for WeBWorK). See <xref ref="section-edfinity" text="title"/> for details. The due date for each assignment is posted in Edfinity. Generally when a topic is on our course calendar, the online homework is due five or six days later. You should start working on it soon after the class that works on that topic, ideally on the same day.</p>

        <p>Collectively, all the online homework is worth 9% of your final grade.</p>
