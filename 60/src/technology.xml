    <p>Part of this course involves teaching you algebra skills, where in the middle of the process you may have to calculate something like <m>\frac{3.1}{1.2}</m>. If you are comfortable doing that by hand, then great. You can rest assured that all exams will give you adequate time to do calculations like this, even if you are doing them all with pencil and paper.</p>

    <p>However you are permitted to use a basic or scientific calculator for <em>parts</em> of exams to speed up steps like this. In the lead-up to each exam I will be more specific about how/if calculator use will be permitted. Pretty much any calculator is acceptable if it is <em>not</em> a graphing calculator. Dollar stores sell very cheap calculators that will work fine for this class. If you are unsure about your calculator, bring it to me.</p>

    <p>You will also need Internet access for most of your homework. If you do not have Internet access at home, you can find it in PCC computer labs.</p>
