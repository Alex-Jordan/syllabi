  <title>Edfinity Assignments</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>I have made an account for you on an online homework platform called Edfinity. Visit Edfinity at <url href="https://edfinity.com/registrations"><c>edfinity.com/registrations</c></url>.</p>
    <p>There is one assignment in Edfinity for (almost) every section we cover in the textbook.</p>

    <p>The due dates for each assignment are visible in Edfinity. I do not duplicate them here in case I might make a mistake. But generally when we cover a section on a Tuesday, that Edfinity assignment is due the following Sunday night. And when we cover a section on a Thursday, that Edfinity assignment is due the following Wednesday night.</p>

    <p>Edfinity homework sets are collectively worth 9% of your grade. If you miss one, you cannot make it up. When the due date passes, everyone gets access to the answers.</p>

    <p>If online homework is too burdensome, please contact me and we can discuss alternative options.</p>
