    <title>Expectations</title>

    <p>MTH 60 can be a challenging course, so the main expectation is that you commit to the course with the goal of passing with an A, and play an active role in your learning. For starters, this means:<ul>
        <li>
            <p>Complete all homework assignments earlier than the due date. Begin working on homework assignments the same day that we discuss that material in class.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Read the assigned material from the textbook and elsewhere.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Make time to visit me in office hours at the slightest sign of difficulty with material.</p>
        </li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>The ideas are covered in a natural sequence, and if you stay on top of the work load, you have every chance of success. Topics will be discussed in class, with exercises that tune the technique and problems that reenforce understanding.  Questions are encouraged both during class and in office hours. Indeed, they are a significant part of the learning process.  All students are further encouraged to work together<mdash />collaboration is an important part of any activity, and it is almost always beneficial for all involved.</p>

    <p>Here are some other expectations:<ul>
        <li>
            <p>Maintain respect for yourself and your classmates.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Do not use phones, tablets, or computers during class time unless it is directly related to a class activity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Check your <c>pcc.edu</c> email at least once a day.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Food and drink can be distracting to other students. Out of respect for others, please do not bring food and drink to class. (Beverages that do not smell strongly and are in spill-proof containers are OK.)</p>
        </li>
    </ul></p>
