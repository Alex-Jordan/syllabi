  <title>Expectations</title>

  <p>
    MTH 60 can be a challenging course,
    so the main expectation is that you commit to the course with the goal of passing with an A,
    and play an active role in your learning. We will be using the <q>flipped</q> classroom model.
    For each day of class:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          You will watch videos before coming to class.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You will take notes on the videos and turn them in at the start of class.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You will answer some <q>reading questions</q> from the textbook and turn them in at the start of class.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In class we will work together in groups <em>practicing</em> what you learned.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You have some online homework to complete within five or six days of the in-class practice.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Occasionally, there will be pencil-and-paper homework to turn in as well.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    There is evidence that the <q>flipped</q> model can raises the pass rates in math courses by a lot!
    More <q>traditional</q> methods for running a class have lately led to a 60% pass rate in MTH 60.
    Flipping could raise this, and those who pass are more likely to pass with an A.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, please:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Try to complete all homework assignments earlier than the due date.
          Begin working on homework assignments the same day that we discuss that material in class.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Make time to visit me in office hours.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    The ideas are covered in a natural sequence, and if you stay on top of the assignments, you have a high chance for success.
    <!-- Topics will be discussed in class, with exercises that tune the technique and problems that reenforce understanding.
    Questions are encouraged both during class and in office hours. Indeed, they are a significant part of the learning process. -->  All students are further encouraged to work together<mdash/>collaboration is an important part of any activity,
    and it is almost always beneficial for all involved.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here are some other expectations:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Maintain respect for yourself and your classmates.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Do not use phones, tablets, or computers during class time unless it is directly related to a class activity.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Check your <c>@pcc.edu</c> email at least once a day.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Food and drink can be distracting to other students.
          Out of respect for others, please do not bring food and drink to class.
          (Beverages that do not smell strongly and are in spill-proof containers are OK.)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
