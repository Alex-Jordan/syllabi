	<p><booktitle>Introductory Algebra for College Students, (Custom Edition for Portland Community College)</booktitle> by Robert Blitzer. This book is a PCC custom edition of a book that is also sold nationally. If you have some version of the Blitzer Introductory Algebra textbook and you are unsure if it will be OK for this class, bring it to me and we will see.</p>

	<p>You can purchase this book from a PCC book store.</p>

    <p>Having unrestricted access to a textbook is a requirement. The best option is to own a copy, but other options include borrowing a copy for the term from a friend.</p>

    <p>Additionally, please download and print the <url href="http://spot.pcc.edu/math/download/60/m60_supplement.pdf">MTH 60 supplemental packet</url>, which adds in a few topics and exercises not covered well enough by the textbook.</p>
