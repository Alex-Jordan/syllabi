Emphasizes applications, graphs, formulas, and proper mathematical notation throughout the course. A scientific calculator may be required. The TI-30X II is recommended. Prerequisites: MTH 20 and (RD 80 or ESOL 250) or equivalent placement. Recommended that MTH 20 be taken within the past 4 terms. The PCC math department recommends that students take MTH courses in consecutive terms. Audit available.</p>

      <title>Expectations</title>
      <p>MTH 60 can be a challenging course, so the main expectation is that you commit to the course with the goal of passing with an A, and play an active role in your learning. We will be using the <q>flipped</q> model of teaching math. For each day of class<ol><li>
            <p>You will watch video lectures before coming to class.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>You will take notes on the video lecture and turn them in when class starts.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>In class we will work together in groups on doing math exercises.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>You have some online homework to complete within five or six days of the in-class practice.</p>
        </li></ol>There is evidence that the <q>flipped</q> model can raises the pass rates in math courses by a lot! More <q>traditional</q> methods for running a class have lately led to a 60% pass rate in MTH 60. Flipping should raise this, and those who pass are more likely to pass with an A.</p>
      <p>Additionally, please:<ul><li>
            <p>Try to complete all homework assignments earlier than the due date. Begin working on homework assignments the same day that we discuss that material in class.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>Make time to visit me in office hours.</p>
        </li></ul></p>
      <p>The ideas are covered in a natural sequence, and if you stay on top of the assignments, you have a high chance for success. <!-- Topics will be discussed in class, with exercises that tune the technique and problems that reenforce understanding.  Questions are encouraged both during class and in office hours. Indeed, they are a significant part of the learning process. -->  All students are further encouraged to work together<mdash/>collaboration is an important part of any activity, and it is almost always beneficial for all involved.</p>
      <p>Here are some other expectations:<ul><li>
            <p>Maintain respect for yourself and your classmates.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>Do not use phones, tablets, or computers during class time unless it is directly related to a class activity.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>Check your <c>@pcc.edu</c> email at least once a day.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>Food and drink can be distracting to other students. Out of respect for others, please do not bring food and drink to class. (Beverages that do not smell strongly and are in spill-proof containers are OK.)</p>

      <title>Technology Requirements</title>
      <p><!-- Part of this class will be learning how technology can assist you in exploring mathematical ideas.   -->In regular class time, a smart phone, tablet, or laptop is fine. During an exam, you must have a scientific <!-- or graphing --> calculator and you may not use other devices that connect to the internet. If you do not own one, there are options for you to borrow one. <!-- The only things you will need a calculator for during an exam are things that a plain old scientific calculator can do, not the specific graphing calculator tools. --></p>
      <p>You will also need Internet access for most of your homework. If you do not have Internet access at home, you can find it in PCC computer labs.</p>

      <introduction>
        <p>General PCC Grading Guidelines are found at <url href="http://catalog.pcc.edu/handbook/g301-gradingguidelines/">catalog.pcc.edu/handbook/g301-gradingguidelines</url>.</p>
      </introduction>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Class Prep Assignments</title>
        <p>Most class days you are supposed to come to class with a class prep assignment completed. You'll turn these in when you come into class. Then while you work on some warm-up exercises, I will look over your prep assignments and give you credit for them. Each one is worth 0.5% of your grade. There are 15 of these total, so all together they are worth 7.5% of your grade</p>
        <p>If you miss class, you may scan/photo your work and send it to me electronically before the end of the day it is due.</p>
      </paragraphs>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>In-class Group Work</title>
        <p>Most class days, you will work in small groups on a collection of exercises that go along with the lesson you prepared for. If you work on these diligently during class time with your partners, you will get credit for 0.5% of your final grade for each one (even if your group is not able to finish these in time). There are 17 of these, so in total these are worth 8.5% of your grade.</p>
        <p>If you miss class, you may bring a <em>fully completed</em> activity to me within one week and still get the 0.5% credit. It must be fully completed, not partially completed. The work must be shown, not just the answers.</p>
        <p>Blank group activities are available for download at the <xref ref="section-calendar" text="title"/>. The day after each one is due, a version with answers will also be posted there. It will just have simple answers, not fully worked out explanations of how to get those answers.</p>
      </paragraphs>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Online Homework</title>
        <p>You have online homework for each section using Edfinity (a front end for WeBWorK). See <xref ref="section-edfinity" text="title"/> for details. The due date for each assignment is posted in Edfinity. Generally when a topic is on our course calendar, the online homework is due five or six days later. You should start working on it soon after the class that works on that topic, ideally on the same day.</p>
        <p>Collectively, all the online homework is worth 9% of your final grade.</p>
      </paragraphs>
      <!-- <paragraphs>
        <title>Written Assignments</title>
        <p>Selections of problems from the textbook will be assigned to be be written up formally.

        <title>Exams</title>
        <p>Please refer to the <xref ref="section-calendar" text="title"/> for exam dates, and <xref text="title" ref="section-exams"/> for details about what is covered on each exam. Exams 1, 2, and 3 are each worth 25%, of your grade.</p>

        <p>The due dates for each assignment are visible in Edfinity. I do not duplicate them here in case I might make a mistake. But generally when we cover a section on a Tuesday, that Edfinity assignment is due the following Sunday night. And when we cover a section on a Thursday, that Edfinity assignment is due the following Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>Edfinity homework sets are collectively worth 9% of your grade. If you miss one, you cannot make it up. When the due date passes, everyone gets access to the answers.</p>

        <title>Missing an Exam</title>
        <p>If you miss an exam, you must contact me within one day to explain why or I might not be able to allow a make-up and you would receive a zero. <alert>Make-up exams are only permitted under extreme circumstances. PCC does not have enough staff and facilities to administer too many make-up exams.</alert> If you have a valid excuse, you must make up the exam within the next two business days, or I might not be able to allow a make-up and you would receive a zero.  If you are going to make up the exam, contact the testing center immediately (<url href="http://www.pcc.edu/resources/testing/proctored/">www.pcc.edu/resources/testing/proctored</url>) to learn what time you might be able to make up the exam.  If you are going to miss the final exam, contact me before the test is given. Since make-up testing is occasionally abused, if you require a make-up test for more than two exams, your scores on all make-up exams will be reduced by 10 percentage points.</p>
        <p>Above all else, <alert>get in contact with me if you have missed or will miss an exam.</alert> Space and time to make up an exam is limited. You need to make arrangements as soon as there is an issue.</p>
