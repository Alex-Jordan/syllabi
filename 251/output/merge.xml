      <title>Expectations</title>
      <p>MTH 95 can be a challenging course, so the main expectation is that you commit to the course with the goal of passing with an A, and play an active role in your learning. For starters, this means:<ul><li>
            <p>Complete all homework assignments earlier than the due date. Begin working on homework assignments the same day that we discuss that material in class.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>Read the assigned material from the textbook and elsewhere.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>Make time to visit me in office hours at the slightest sign of difficulty with material.</p>
        </li></ul></p>
      <p>The ideas are covered in a natural sequence, and if you stay on top of the work load, you have every chance of success. Topics will be discussed in class, with exercises that tune the technique and problems that reenforce understanding.  Questions are encouraged both during class and in office hours. Indeed, they are a significant part of the learning process.  All students are further encouraged to work together<mdash/>collaboration is an important part of any activity, and it is almost always beneficial for all involved.</p>
      <p>Here are some other expectations:<ul><li>
            <p>Maintain respect for yourself and your classmates.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>Do not use phones, tablets, or computers during class time unless it is directly related to a class activity.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>Check your <c>pcc.edu</c> email at least once a day.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>Food and drink can be distracting to other students. Out of respect for others, please do not bring food and drink to class. (Beverages that do not smell strongly and are in spill-proof containers are OK.)</p>
        </li></ul></p>

    <section xml:id="technology">
      <title>Technology Requirements</title>
      <p>Part of this class will be learning how technology can assist you in exploring mathematical ideas.  In regular class time, a smart phone, tablet, or laptop is fine. During an exam, you must have a scientific or graphing calculator and you may not use other devices that connect to the internet. If you do not own one, there are options for you to borrow one. The only things you will need a calculator for during an exam are things that a plain old scientific calculator can do, not the specific graphing calculator tools.</p>
      <p>You will need Internet access for most of your homework. If you do not have Internet access at home, you can find it in PCC computer labs.</p>

      <title>Grades</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
      General PCC Grading Guidelines are found at
      <url href="http://catalog.pcc.edu/handbook/g301-gradingguidelines/">catalog.pcc.edu/handbook/g301-gradingguidelines</url>.
    </p>
      </introduction>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>In-class Group Work</title>
        <p>
      Most class days, you will work in small groups on a collection of exercises that go along with the lesson of the day.
      If you work on these diligently during class time with your partners,
      you will get credit for 0.5% of your final grade for each one (even if your group is not able to finish these in time).
      Sixteen of these count toward your final grade, so in total these are worth 8% of your grade.
    </p>
        <p>
      If you miss class, you may bring a <em>fully completed</em> activity to me within one week and still get the 0.5% credit.
      The online syllabus will have the exercise packets from each day for you to download
      using the <xref ref="section-calendar" text="title"/>.
      Turning these in late, they must be fully completed, not partially completed. The work must be shown, not just the answers.
    </p>
      </paragraphs>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Online Homework</title>
        <p>
      You have online homework for each section using <webwork/>. See <xref ref="section-webwork" text="title"/> for details.
      The due date for each assignment is posted in <webwork/>. Generally when a topic is on our course calendar,
      the online homework is due the following Wednesday evening.
      You should start working on it soon after the class that works on that topic, ideally on the same day.
    </p>
        <p>
      Collectively, all the online homework is worth 10% of your final grade.
    </p>
      </paragraphs>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Written Assignments</title>
        <p>
        In the last third of the course, your homework includes some exercises where you must write up something on paper.
        Turn these in on the days they are due.
        Each written assignment is worth 2% of your grade for a total of 6%.
        See <xref text="title" ref="section-written-assignments"/> for the specifics.
      </p>
      </paragraphs>
      <!-- <paragraphs>
    <title>Contribution to the Book</title>
    <p>The details of this assignment are at <xref text="title" ref="section-contributions"/>. You will write some content that could be added to our textbook. This assignment is worth <quantity><mag>6</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> of your final grade.</p>
  </paragraphs> -->
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Exams</title>
        <p>
      Please refer to the <xref ref="section-calendar" text="title"/> for exam dates,
      and <xref text="title" ref="section-exams"/> for details about what is covered on each exam.
      Exams 1, 2, and 3 are each worth 25%, 25%, and 26%, of your grade.
    </p>
      </paragraphs>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Optional Class Prep Assignments</title>
        <p>
      This is an opportunity to reduce the weight of the exams down to just 21%, 21%, and 22%,
      padding your grade with some work that is easy to do if you budget time for it.
      At the same time, it wil get you to engage more fully with the material and it should ultimately
      help you do better on the exams.
    </p>
        <p>
      Each class day, you could come to class having <em>already</em> watched the video lessons for the day's section.
      As you watch the videos, there are video lecture notes that you could complete.
      Bringing these notes to me on the class day counts as proof that you watch the videos and engaged with them.
      For each section, I will record that you watched the videos and took notes, which credits you with 0.5% toward your grade,
      reducing the corresponding exam weight by 0.5%.
    </p>
        <p>
      If you miss class, you may scan/photo your work and send it to me electronically before the end of the day it is due.
    </p>
        <p>
      You may find the videos and the video lecture notes on the <xref ref="section-calendar" text="title"/>.
      In class on the first day, we will discuss more how this works.

    at 10:00<nbsp/><pm/>, but can be worked on much earlier.
    You may submit answers any time before the due date. You may work from home or use PCC computer labs to turn in your answers.
  </p>
      <p>
    Here is an example of what a <webwork/> problem is like.

        <title>Why are we using WeBWorK?</title>
        <p>
      Traditionally, homework comes from textbook problems that students would do on paper, and then turn in in to the instructor.
      One drawback of this is that students get no feedback at all until about a week later,
      and at that point the student is no longer actively thinking about material from two weeks earlier.
      Another drawback is that it is impossible for a student to do the appropriate amount of homework
      and for the instructor to give quality feedback for every single exercise.
      Often an instructor is only able to give feedback for a small subset of the exercises.
      Using <webwork/> brings the following advantages over traditional homework.
    </p>
        <p>
      <dl><li>
          <title>Cost</title>
          <p>
            <webwork/> is free, unlike many online homework programs.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <title>Timely Feedback</title>
          <p>
            Rather than waiting a week for written feedback from your instructor, you get instant feedback from <webwork/>.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <title>Quality Feedback</title>
          <p>
            <webwork/> will do more than just tell you if you are right or wrong.
            For example, it will usually tell you if you haven't completely simplified an answer
            or forgot to include units when they are required. Sometimes it will do even more.
            Try entering <c>x^12</c> as the answer to <xref text="type-global" ref="webwork-demo"/>.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <title>Ease of Communication</title>
          <p>
            <webwork/> encourages you to write your instructor for help,
            who can provide even higher quality feedback based on your message and your previous attempts.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <title>Multiple or Unlimited Attempts</title>
          <p>
            On paper, when you submit an answer, that's the end of it.
            With <webwork/> you might get a problem wrong on your first attempt,
            but you are encouraged to figure out your mistakes and try again.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <title>Efficient Use of Class Time</title>
          <p>
            Your instructor can monitor the whole class and see in real-time
            which problems and concepts are causing the class difficulty.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <title>Extra Practice</title>
          <p>
            Your instructor can set things up so that you can retry each problem with new random numbers involved.
            If you are unsure if you have mastered a skill, this gives you a way to keep practicing.

      Write a message explaining what you have tried and if possible, include the work from your calculations.
      <webwork/> will send your instructor an email with helpful information (like all of the incorrect attempts you have tried)
      and they get back to you soon with a response. When they respond, it will be with an email,
      so <alert>you must remember to check your email</alert>.

        <title>Math Achievements</title>
        <p>
      As you complete more problems through the term, you will win badges for various <q>achievements</q>.
      For example, the <q>On One Hand</q> badge is for completing a homework set with fewer than five incorrect submissions.
      Both earning badges and just plain answering questions correctly will earn you <q>achievement points</q>.
      As you gain more achievement points, you will level up.
      Each time you level up, you earn an item that can be used to affect your grade.

      <title>Written Assignments</title>
      <p>
    These must be turned in no later than their posted due dates.
    These are where you will get to show me your mathematical writing and graphing skills.
  </p>
      <p>
    The most important thing to understand about your written homework
    is that <alert>you are not merely finding and giving answers</alert>.
    You are <em>explaining to someone what the problem was, how you handled it, and summarizing the results.</em>
    In general, your write-ups should respect these <q>five C's</q>:
    <dl width="narrow"><li>
        <title>Clarity</title>
        <p>
          Am I able to read your work? Is your writing legible?
          Have you written complete sentences that make sense, where appropriate?
          If you have charts, graphs, and mathematical expressions, have you clearly indicated what they represent?
          Generally, any graphs need their axes labeled with regularly spaced tick marks, and they need some kind of overall title.
          If something about your write-up causes me to pause and wonder what you mean, you will lose clarity points.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <title>Correctness</title>
        <p>
          Are your numerical answers and conclusions accurate?
          Often you can check that your numbers are correct by substituting numbers back into earlier equations.
          Also, by asking yourself if the numbers that you find make sense in the context of the problem.
          It's not a bad idea to include these checks with your work.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <title>Conciseness</title>
        <p>
          Have you rambled on with extra content that is not relevant to solving the problem?
          This is distracting and hurts the overall ability of your write-up to communicate effectively.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <title>self-Containment</title>
        <p>
          The response to the question that you submit should make it clear what the original question was.
          Put yourself in the shoes of another student from the class
          who does not have the original homework assignment in front of them.
          Would they be able to understand what you are talking about? At a minimum,
          this means that <alert>you must give an introduction of some kind that lets your reader know
          what you are about to investigate</alert>.
          Also, include any and all charts, graphs, and mathematical expressions that were given in the problem,
          and explain their meaning, even if you do so merely with labels.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>
          Some problems come with context (<q>word problems</q>).
          When writing your final answer to such a question,
          you need to put that answer in its full context with a conclusion statement that is a complete English sentence.
          As an example, writing <q><m>x=70</m></q> or <q>He needs $70</q> will not be good enough
          if there is more context to the problem.
          Instead, something like <q>Dmitri needs $70 in order to purchase a new lawnmower</q>
          is a conclusion statement with all of the context in it.
          For problems without context, conclusion statements like <q>The solution set is <m>\{70\}</m>.</q> are acceptable.

        <p>
      If you miss an exam, you must contact me within one day to explain why
      or I might not be able to allow a make-up and you would receive a zero.
      <alert>Make-up exams are only permitted under extreme circumstances.
      PCC does not have enough staff and facilities to administer too many make-up exams.</alert>
      If you have a valid excuse, you must make up the exam within the next two business days,
      or I might not be able to allow a make-up and you would receive a zero.
      If you are going to make up the exam, contact the testing center immediately
      (<url href="http://www.pcc.edu/resources/testing/proctored/">www.pcc.edu/resources/testing/proctored</url>)
      to learn what time you might be able to make up the exam.
      If you are going to miss the final exam, contact me before the test is given.
    </p>
        <p>
      Above all else, <alert>get in contact with me if you have missed or will miss an exam.</alert>
      Space and time to make up an exam is limited. You need to make arrangements as soon as there is an issue.
