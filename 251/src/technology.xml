    <title>Technology Requirements</title>

    <p>
    	Since we are in a remote teaching mode, it is essential that you have access to a computer, laptop, tablet, or at the very least a smart phone.
    	And you need internet access. Ideally, your device and internet connection will work with the Zoom sessions,
    	but otherwise you can call in to the Zoom meetings. You do not need to purchase or install Zoom.
    </p>

    <p>
    	We will be using Google Docs for the labs and lab write-ups. As a PCC student, you have access to Google Docs.
    	Typically I will simply send you a link to a Google Doc as needed. You may access all of your Google Docs by using PCC Gmail,
    	and using the 3<times/>3 icon in the upper right.
    </p>

    <p>
    	Homework and quizzes use <webwork/>. You log in to your <webwork/> account using a web browser.
