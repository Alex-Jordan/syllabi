  <p>
    The official timeline for this course will be managed with D2L.
    What matters most is whatever dates are in the modules inside D2L.
    Details may change as the term progresses, and this will be reflected in the D2L modules.
    So the information below is subject to change.
    It is only included here for a quick reference at the start of the term.
