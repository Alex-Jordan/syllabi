    <title>Expectations</title>

    <p>
        This term we are responding to the coronavirus pandemic.
        The physcial buildings at PCC are closed, and we cannot conduct the usual face-to-face instruction that we are all used to
        (both as students and as instructors).
    </p>

    <p>
        We all have extra responsibilities this term. As the instructor, I need to find new ways to deliver the instruction to you at home.
        I need to be creative and flexible with how we use technology. And you, the student, need to have the self-discipline to complete
        everything that I ask of you. And also to be brave and bring all of your concerns and questions to me as soon as you can.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can boil down your responsibilities to the following list.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Sign in to the live sessions we will have in Zoom every Monday and Wednesday at 9:00.
                    I will give a brief overview of the important points of the day, and I will take your questions,
                    including questions you have about examples and exercises.
                    Then we will usually move to the lab portion of the class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have to miss all or part of a class session, watch the recording of the overview portion.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Collaborate with your lab partners on the lab assignments during our live sessions.
                    <em>When needed</em>, continue to collaborate with your lab partners outside of class.
                    Your lab group must complete write-ups of each lab by its due date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have to miss a lab session, complete the lab on your own by its due date.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Read sections of the <url href="http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~fitzpat/apex-calculus/">textbook</url> <em>ahead</em> of class.
                    We will not be using class time to demonstrate examples,
                    which is common in an in-person classroom setting. It would not be the best use of our time.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Watch the videos that are embedded in the version of the <url href="http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~fitzpat/apex-calculus/">textbook</url>
                    that I am directing you to. My colleague at University of Lethbridge produced these videos
                    and they were made for our book specifically.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Complete the homework exercises that are assigned in <webwork/>.
                    There will be a problem set associated to each section of the textbook that we cover.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Complete the weekly quiz that is assigned in <webwork/>.
                    Each quiz is timed, and uses the questions from homework where the class had the least amount of success.
                    This is intended to motivate you to do all of the homework and ask questions when you do not understand something yet.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Use all the tools available to you to communicate with me about your concerns and your questions.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Direct Email</li>
