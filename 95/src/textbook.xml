    We are using a <em>free</em> textbook written by PCC faculty. The book is called <pubtitle>ORCCA
    (Open Resources for Community College Algebra)</pubtitle>. We're excited to replace an expensive
    textbook with this free book and save you money. If you find any issues with this book where you
    think we could make it better, please let me know about each one.
