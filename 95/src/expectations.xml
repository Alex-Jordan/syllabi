  <title>Expectations</title>
  <p>
    Students in this course are expected to enter the course several times a week. In addition to
    work through the modules, class announcements are posted on our D2L course landing page, and it
    is your responsibility to read these announcements.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are also expected to check your <c>pcc.edu</c> email daily. Along with the announcements in
    D2L, I sometimes send important information in mass emails to the class. It is your
    responsibility to read these messages as they come. Also I may be replying to a message that you
    initiated, and I am only permitted to contact you using your pcc.edu email address.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are not going to take exams using <q>remote proctoring</q> on the official exam dates
    with the rest of the class, then you have responsibilities to make other arrangements according
    to <xref ref="section-exams"/>. These arrangements need to be in place typically two weeks ahead
    of the exam.
  </p>
  <p>
    Make an honest effort to collaborate with your partners on the worksheet assignments. As this is
    an asynchronous class, and everyone has different schedules and outside responsibilities, it is
    not always possible. But it can be rewarding to make connections with the handful of people in
    your group.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reach out to me or a tutor early when you are having trouble with a topic. Your responsibility
    is to recognize when you need this help. We can make a plan to help you if we have enough time.
    We might meet over Zoom or in person, whatever we need to do.
