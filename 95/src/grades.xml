    <title>Group Work</title>
    <p>
      Most class days, you will work in small groups on a collection of exercises.
      Work on these diligently during class time with your partners,
      and then turn in a completed write-up. You and your partners might finish during class,
      but you may need to arrange to meet with each other after class.
      You need to complete each activity before the next class meets.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you miss class, you may complete the activity on your own and turn it in before the next class.
    </p>

    <p>
      One grade will be assigned for each activity. All group memebers share the grade.
      Each activity is worth 1% of your final grade, for a total of 16%.
      (There will actually be 18 of these, and the lowest two scores will be dropped.)
    </p>
  </paragraphs>

  <paragraphs>
    <title>Video Lecture Notes</title>
    <p>
      With each section of the book, there are video lectures for you to watch.
      As you watch them, there are video lecture notes you can fill out.
      Complete each one <em>before</em> class, uploading it into the assignments in D2L.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are 24 of these, and they are each worth 0.25% of your grade, for a total of 6%.
    </p>

    <p>
      These are due <em>before</em> class starts. If you submit this to D2L late,
      then you will only earn half credit.
    </p>
  </paragraphs>

  <paragraphs>
    <title>Online Homework</title>
    <p>
      You have online homework for each section using <webwork/>. See <xref ref="section-webwork" text="title"/> for details.
      The due date for each assignment is posted in <webwork/>.
      Usually, more than one section will be due at the same time.
      You should start working on a homework assignment soon after the class that is associated with that section of the book.
    </p>

    <p>
      Collectively, all the online homework is worth 12% of your final grade.
    </p>
  </paragraphs>

  <paragraphs>
    <title>Quizzes</title>
    <p>
      You have weekly quizzes using <webwork/>.
      Each <webwork/> <em>homework</em> assignment is due in the middle of the week.
      I will build a quiz that uses those homework questions for which there was the least overall success,
      but still appropriate for a 1-hour time limit.
      This is intended to motivate you to do all of the homework and ask questions when you do not understand something yet.
      You take these quizzes when you are able to, but they must be completed by Friday evening at 10:00pm.
      Each quiz is worth 2% and there are 8 quizzes, for a total of 16%.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
      See <xref ref="section-webwork" text="title"/> for details.
      The due date for each assignment is posted in <webwork/>. Generally when a topic is on our course calendar,
      the online homework is due the following Wednesday evening.
      You should start working on it soon after the class that works on that topic, ideally on the same day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Collectively, all the online homework is worth 10% of your final grade.

    <title>Written Assignments</title>
      <p>
        In the last third of the course, your homework includes some exercises where you must write up something on paper.
        Turn these in on the days they are due.
        Each written assignment is worth 2% of your grade for a total of 6%.
        See <xref text="title" ref="section-written-assignments"/> for the specifics.

    <title>Contribution to the Book</title>
    <p>The details of this assignment are at <xref text="title" ref="section-contributions"/>. You will write some content that could be added to our textbook. This assignment is worth <quantity><mag>6</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> of your final grade.</p>

    <title>Exams</title>
    <p>
      The final exam will either be Tuesday June 9 or Wednesday June 10, depending on which section you are in.
      Hopefully it will be on campus, in our classroom CH 210.
      At this time we can't be sure. The final exam will be worth 25% of your grade.
    </p>

    <p>
      There will also be a midterm exam. Because of the virus response, its format and location are not yet known.
      Tentatively, it will be an in-person exam in our classroom CH 210, either Wednesday May 6 or Thursday May 7.
      The midterm will be worth 25% of your grade.

    <title>Optional Class Prep Assignments</title>
    <p>
      This is an opportunity to reduce the weight of the exams down to just 21%, 21%, and 22%,
      padding your grade with some work that is easy to do if you budget time for it.
      At the same time, it wil get you to engage more fully with the material and it should ultimately
      help you do better on the exams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each class day, you could come to class having <em>already</em> watched the video lessons for the day's section.
      As you watch the videos, there are video lecture notes that you could complete.
      Bringing these notes to me on the class day counts as proof that you watch the videos and engaged with them.
      For each section, I will record that you watched the videos and took notes, which credits you with 0.5% toward your grade,
      reducing the corresponding exam weight by 0.5%.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you miss class, you may scan/photo your work and send it to me electronically before the end of the day it is due.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may find the videos and the video lecture notes on the <xref ref="section-calendar" text="title"/>.
      In class on the first day, we will discuss more how this works.

    <title>In-class Group Work</title>
    <p>
      Most class days, you will work in small groups on a collection of exercises that go along with the lesson of the day.
      If you work on these diligently during class time with your partners,
      you will get credit for 0.5% of your final grade for each one (even if your group is not able to finish these in time).
      Sixteen of these count toward your final grade, so in total these are worth 8% of your grade.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you miss class, you may bring a <em>fully completed</em> activity to me within one week and still get the 0.5% credit.
      The online syllabus will have the exercise packets from each day for you to download
      using the <xref ref="section-calendar" text="title"/>.
      Turning these in late, they must be fully completed, not partially completed. The work must be shown, not just the answers.
