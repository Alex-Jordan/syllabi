  <p>
    I have made an account for you on an online homework platform called <webwork/>. You can access
    <webwork/> using the navbar in our D2L course. Each week there are problem sets and you are
    required to answer them online in <webwork/>. Each problem set is due at 10:00 <pm/> on Sunday
    at the end of that module's week. You may submit answers any time before the due date.

    <title>Late Work</title>
    <p>
      After a due date, you still have up to two weeks to answer <webwork/> exercises and get 95%
      credit. It's usually a two-week window, however the window is shorter right before the midterm
      or final exam. The idea is that you really should complete all homework before coming in to
      take an exam.

    <title>Homework Sets Menu</title>
    <p>This shows you the assignments that have been assigned to you and when they are due. You may:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            click on an assignment and begin working on problems online
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            check the box next to an assignment and click <c>Download Hardcopy</c> to get the assignment as a <c>.pdf</c> file
            which you may then print to work on away from a computer.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      When you click on an assignment, you will see a screen with the problem numbers listed.
      Off to the right is a message for you that might have specific instructions or information about the assignment.
      You should always look for and read this message.

    <title>Emailing for Help</title>
    <p>
      When you are stumped, you can click the <c>Email Instructor</c> button at the bottom of any
      problem. Write a message explaining what you have tried and if possible, include the work from
      your calculations. <webwork/> will send me (your instructor) an email with helpful information
      (like all of the incorrect attempts you have tried) and I will get back to you soon with a
      response. When I respond, it will be with an email, so you must remember to check your own
      email.

    <title>Math Achievements</title>
    <p>
      As you complete more problems, you win badges for various <q>achievements</q>. For example,
      the <q>On One Hand</q> badge is for completing a homework set with fewer than five incorrect
      submissions. Both earning badges and just plain answering questions correctly will earn you
      <q>achievement points</q>. As you gain more achievement points, you will level up. Each time
      you level up, you earn an item that can be used to affect your grade.
