    The two exams are proctored. We will use <q>remote proctoring</q> where you take the exam from
    home (or wherever) but we will use Zoom to allow me to monitor your workspace. For details, see
    <xref ref="section-exams"/>, but the most important thing for now is to plan to be somewhere on
    the exam dates that is quiet and comfortable, and also has a strong internet connection.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will meet with you over Zoom as needed, and frequently invite you to meet with me that way.
    There will be a few times each week (regularly scheduled) where I have Zoom open and you can
    just drop in. During the first week I will survey students to find what time(s) would work best
    for that. We can also always meet as needed at sporadic times with a little advanced notice.
