    Each weekly module has a worksheet assignment. There are several purposes of these assignments:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Ask questions that are too complex for <webwork/> to assess automatically.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Allow me to review your <em>process</em> for finding answers, so I can make sure that you
          do not have a fundamental misunderstanding.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Develop your ability to <em>explain</em> how to reach an answer, which is something that
          an online homework problem cannot do.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Give our online course a sense of community, since you will be encouraged to work together
          in a small group.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    During the first week you will use a D2L discussion forum to find a group to work with through
    the term. You should organize yourselves according to what times of the week you are available.
    Some students can only work together in the evenings, some in the mornings on weekends, etc.

      Worksheets have a due date in D2L. Completing them by the due date helps you stay on pace to
      be successful. If you miss a due date, D2L will still allow you to turn in the assignment for
      up to two weeks, and I will still grade it with no penalty to your score. However, that
      <q>two-week window</q> is shorter right before an exam. This is because you should be required
      to complete the assignments before you come in to take an exam.
