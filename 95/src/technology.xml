    <title>Technology Requirements</title>

    <p>Part of this class will be learning how technology can assist you in exploring mathematical ideas.  In regular class time, a smart phone, tablet, or laptop is fine. During an exam, you must have a scientific or graphing calculator and you may not use other devices that connect to the internet. If you do not own one, there are options for you to borrow one. The only things you will need a calculator for during an exam are things that a plain old scientific calculator can do, not the specific graphing calculator tools.</p>

    <p>You will also need Internet access for most of your homework. If you do not have Internet access at home, you can find it in PCC computer labs.</p>
