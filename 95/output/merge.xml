      <title>Expectations</title>
      <p>MTH 95 can be a challenging course, so the main expectation is that you commit to the course with the goal of passing with an A, and play an active role in your learning. For starters, this means:<ul><li>
            <p>Complete all homework assignments earlier than the due date. Begin working on homework assignments the same day that we discuss that material in class.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>Read the assigned material from the textbook and elsewhere.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>Make time to visit me in office hours at the slightest sign of difficulty with material.</p>
        </li></ul></p>
      <p>The ideas are covered in a natural sequence, and if you stay on top of the work load, you have every chance of success. Topics will be discussed in class, with exercises that tune the technique and problems that reenforce understanding.  Questions are encouraged both during class and in office hours. Indeed, they are a significant part of the learning process.  All students are further encouraged to work together<mdash/>collaboration is an important part of any activity, and it is almost always beneficial for all involved.</p>
      <p>Here are some other expectations:<ul><li>
            <p>Maintain respect for yourself and your classmates.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>Do not use phones, tablets, or computers during class time unless it is directly related to a class activity.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>Check your <c>pcc.edu</c> email at least once a day.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>Food and drink can be distracting to other students. Out of respect for others, please do not bring food and drink to class. (Beverages that do not smell strongly and are in spill-proof containers are OK.)</p>
        </li></ul></p>

    <!-- This file is part of Alex Jordan's syllabus -->
    <section xml:id="technology">
      <title>Technology Requirements</title>
      <p>Part of this class will be learning how technology can assist you in exploring mathematical ideas.  In regular class time, a smart phone, tablet, or laptop is fine. During an exam, you must have a scientific or graphing calculator and you may not use other devices that connect to the internet. If you do not own one, there are options for you to borrow one. The only things you will need a calculator for during an exam are things that a plain old scientific calculator can do, not the specific graphing calculator tools.</p>
      <p>You will also need Internet access for most of your homework. If you do not have Internet access at home, you can find it in PCC computer labs.</p>

      <title>Textbook</title>
      <p>We are using a new <em>free</em> textbook written by PCC faculty. The book is called <pubtitle>ORCCA (Open Resources for Community College Algebra)</pubtitle>. We're excited to replace a roughly <m>\$117</m> book with this free book and save you a significant amount of money. This is only the second term this book is being used for MTH 95 at PCC, and we will be asking you for your thoughts and feedback about it. We will work to make it better every term from here on out, so that future students have a free, excellent MTH 95 textbook.</p>
      <p>If you find any issues with this book where you think we could make it better, please let me know about each one.</p>
      <p>Access this book:<ul><li>

      <introduction>
        <p>General PCC Grading Guidelines are found at <url href="http://catalog.pcc.edu/handbook/g301-gradingguidelines/">catalog.pcc.edu/handbook/g301-gradingguidelines</url>.</p>
      </introduction>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Attendance/Participation</title>
        <p>Each day of class that you attend is worth <quantity><mag>0.25</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> of your grade, up to a maximum of <quantity><mag>4</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity>. This does not include holidays, inservice days, or days where the entire class period is devoted to an exam. Typically in a term this leaves at least one absence that would not have a direct effect on your grade. However missing class will hurt your chances for success on exams because you will not get the same attention that your classmates had.</p>
      </paragraphs>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Web Assignments</title>
        <p>Most of your homework for this class is to be submitted online through the free program <webwork/>. For details, see <xref ref="section-webwork" text="type-global"/>. Collectively, all web assignments are worth <quantity><mag>16</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> of your final grade. For every web assignment that you do not submit (or have a poor score for), I will <em>replace</em> that score with the score you get on your next exam.</p>
        <p>If you write up all of the problems from a web homework on paper, you may turn that in so that I may review your math communication style and give you feedback. This is <em>not</em> a replacement for doing the web homework online. Instead, if you do this, I will add up to 10<percent/> to those web assignments. For example, suppose your <webwork/> grade for an assignment is 85<percent/> and you turn in a write-up of those problems. Suppose that I grade your write-up to be <m>9/10</m>. Then your final recorded score for the assignment will be <m>85\%+9\%=94\%</m>.</p>
      </paragraphs>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Written Assignments</title>
        <p>Some problems will be assigned to write up and turn in. These will be exercises where part of the task is to create some kind of graph, so <webwork/> will not be able to grade you. Each written assignment is worth <quantity><mag>1</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> of your grade for a total of <quantity><mag>5</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity>. See <xref ref="section-written-assignments"/> for the specifics.</p>
      </paragraphs>
      <!-- <paragraphs>
        <title>Written Assignments</title>
        <p>Selections of problems from the textbook will be assigned to be be written up formally. Each written assignment is worth <quantity><mag>1</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> of your grade for a total of <quantity><mag>10</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity>. See <xref text="title" ref="section-written-assignments"/> for the specifics.</p>
    </paragraphs> -->
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Late Homework</title>
        <p>Web assignments are due whenever <webwork/> says they are due for full credit.  There is no way to get credit for a late web assignment (unless you unlock an achievement item reward). After the due date, you may still type in answers to check your work, but doing so will not increase your score. After the due date, answers are available if you re-visit the problem. Any <webwork/> score can be <em>overwritten</em> by your next exam score, if that is to your benefit.</p>
        <p>You may <em>always</em> ask me for an extension to the web homework due date, as long as you ask well <em>before</em> the due date. I cannot change the due date for you if the problem set closes first. If you need an extension, please email me to request that at least 24 hours before the regular due date.</p>
        <p>Written assignments that are received late may receive a zero. If I have already graded the stack of everyone else's papers, then it is absolutely too late. You may try to turn in something late, and if I have not yet graded everyone else's, then I can grade yours.</p>
      </paragraphs>
      <!-- <paragraphs>
        <title>Contribution to the Book</title>
        <p>The details of this assignment are at <xref text="title" ref="section-contributions"/>. You will write some content that could be added to our textbook. This assignment is worth <quantity><mag>6</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> of your final grade.</p>
    </paragraphs> -->
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Exams</title>
        <p>Please refer to the <xref ref="section-calendar" text="title"/> for exam dates, and <xref text="title" ref="section-exams"/> for details about what is covered on each exam. Exams 1, 2, and 3 are each worth <quantity><mag>25</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity>, of your grade.</p>

      <title>WeBWorK Assignments</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>I have made an account for you on a program called <webwork/> at <url href="https://webwork.pcc.edu/webwork2/mth095-jordan-201804-facetoface/">webwork.pcc.edu/webwork2/mth095-jordan-201804-facetoface</url>. Each week I will assign problem sets and you are required to answer them online using <webwork/>. The topics that we cover in a week have exercises that are typically due in the middle of the following week at 10:00<nbsp/><pm/> on the night in between the days we meet, but can be worked on much earlier. You may submit answers any time before the due date. You may work from home or use PCC computer labs to turn in your answers.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of what a <webwork/> problem is like.</p>
        <exercise xml:id="webwork-demo">

        <title>Why are we using WeBWorK?</title>
        <p>Traditionally, homework comes from textbook problems that students would do on paper, and then turn in in to the instructor.  One drawback of this is that students get no feedback at all until about a week later, and at that point the student is no longer actively thinking about material from two weeks earlier.  Another drawback is that it is impossible for a student to do the appropriate amount of homework and for the instructor to give quality feedback for every single exercise.   Often an instructor is only able to give feedback for a small subset of the exercises.  Using <webwork/> brings the following advantages over traditional homework.</p>
        <p>
          <dl>
            <li>
                <title>Cost</title>
                <p><webwork/> is free, unlike most online homework programs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Timely Feedback</title>
                <p>Rather than waiting a week for written feedback from your instructor, you get instant feedback from <webwork/>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Quality Feedback</title>
                <p><webwork/> will do more than just tell you if you are right or wrong.  For example, it will usually tell you if you haven't completely simplified an answer or forgot to include units when they are required. Sometimes it will do even more. Try entering <c>x^12</c> as the answer to <xref text="type-global" ref="webwork-demo"/>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Ease of Communication</title>
                <p><webwork/> encourages you to write your instructor for help, who can provide even higher quality feedback based on your message and your previous attempts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Multiple or Unlimited Attempts</title>
                <p>On paper, when you submit an answer, that's the end of it. With <webwork/> you might get a problem wrong on your first attempt, but you are encouraged to figure out your mistakes and try again.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Efficient Use of Class Time</title>
                <p>Your instructor can monitor the whole class and see in real-time which problems and concepts are causing the class difficulty.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Extra Practice</title>
                <p>Your instructor can set things up so that you can retry each problem with new random numbers involved. If you are unsure if you have mastered a skill, this gives you a way to keep practicing.</p>

        <title>Math Achievements</title>
        <p>As you complete more problems through the term, you will win badges for various <q>achievements</q>. For example, the <q>On One Hand</q> badge is for completing a homework set with fewer than five incorrect submissions.  Both earning badges and just plain answering questions correctly will earn you <q>achievement points</q>. As you gain more achievement points, you will level up. Each time you level up, you earn an item that can be used to affect your grade.</p>

    <section xml:id="section-written-assignments">
      <title>Written Assignments</title>
      <p>These must be turned in no later than their posted due dates. Written assignments are each worth <quantity><mag>1</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> of your final grade, and there will be ten in total. That means they are worth <quantity><mag>10</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> in total, so you cannot expect to pass this course with an A unless you are turning these assignments in. These are where you will get to show me your mathematical writing skills and work on your ability to create a convincing logical argument.</p>
      <p>The most important thing to understand about your written homework is that <alert>you are not merely finding and giving answers.</alert> You are <em>explaining to someone what the problem was, how you handled it, and summarizing the results.</em>  In general, your write-ups should respect these <q>five C's</q>:<ol><li>
            <p>Clarity. Am I able to read your work? Is your writing legible? Have you written complete sentences that make sense, where appropriate? If you have charts, graphs, and mathematical expressions, have you clearly indicated what they represent? Generally, any graphs need their axes labeled with regularly spaced tick marks, and they need some kind of overall title. If something about your write-up causes me to pause and wonder what you mean, you will lose clarity points.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>Correctness. Are your numerical answers and conclusions accurate? Often you can check that your numbers are correct by substituting numbers back into earlier equations. Also, by asking yourself if the numbers that you find make sense in the context of the problem. It's not a bad idea to include these checks with your work.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>Conciseness. Have you rambled on with extra content that is not relevant to solving the problem? This is distracting and hurts the overall ability of your write-up to communicate effectively.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>self-Containment. The response to the question that you submit should make it clear what the original question was. Put yourself in the shoes of another student from the class who does not have the original homework assignment in front of them. Would they be able to understand what you are talking about? At a minimum, this means that <alert>you must give an introduction of some kind that lets your reader know what you are about to investigate</alert>. Also, include any and all charts, graphs, and mathematical expressions that were given in the problem, and explain their meaning, even if you do so merely with labels.</p>
        </li><li>
            <p>Conclusions. Some problems come with context (<q>word problems</q>). When writing your final answer to such a question, you need to put that answer in its full context with a conclusion statement that is a complete English sentence. As an example, writing <q><m>x=70</m></q> or <q>He needs <dollar/>70</q> will not be good enough if there is more context to the problem. Instead, something like <q>Dmitri needs <dollar/>70 in order to purchase a new lawnmower</q> is a conclusion statement with all of the context in it. For problems without context, conclusion statements like <q>So the domain of <m>f</m> is <m>[0,\infty)</m>.</q> are acceptable.</p>

        <title>Missing an Exam</title>
        <p>If you miss an exam, you must contact me within one day to explain why or I might not be able to allow a make-up and you would receive a zero. <alert>Make-up exams are only permitted under extreme circumstances. PCC does not have enough staff and facilities to administer too many make-up exams.</alert> If you have a valid excuse, you must make it up within the next two business days, or I might not be able to allow a make-up and you would receive a zero.  If you are going to make up the exam, contact the testing center immediately (<url href="http://www.pcc.edu/resources/testing/proctored/">www.pcc.edu/resources/testing/proctored</url>) to learn what time you might be able to make up the exam.  If you are going to miss the final exam, contact me before the test is given. Since make-up testing is occasionally abused, if you require a make-up test for more than two exams, your scores on all make-up exams will be reduced by 10 percentage points.</p>
        <p>Above all else, <alert>get in contact with me if you have missed or will miss an exam.</alert> Space and time to make up an exam is limited. You need to make arrangements as soon as there is an issue.</p>
