    <title>Textbook</title>

    <p>
        We are using a new <em>free</em> textbook written by PCC faculty.
        The book is called <pubtitle>ORCCA (Open Resources for Community College Algebra)</pubtitle>.
        We are excited to replace a roughly $117 book with this free book and save you money.
        This is only the second year this book is being used for MTH 65 at PCC,
        and we will be asking you for your thoughts and feedback about it.
        We will work to make it better every term from here on out,
        so that future students have a free, excellent MTH 65 textbook.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you find any issues with this book where you think we could make it better,
        please let me know about each one.
