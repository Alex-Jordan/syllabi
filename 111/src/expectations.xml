    <p>MTH 111 is a technically demanding course which is paced steadily and introduces concepts that form the foundation of calculus.  The ideas are covered in a natural sequence, and if the student stays on top of the work load, they have every chance of success.  Topics will be discussed in class, with exercises that tune the technique and problems that reenforce understanding.</p>

    <p>At this level of learning, the student is responsible for ensuring their own understanding.  Questions are encouraged both during class and in office hours. Indeed, they are a significant part of the learning process.  All students are further encouraged to work together<mdash/>collaboration is an important part of any activity, and it is almost always beneficial for all involved.</p>
