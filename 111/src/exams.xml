    <title>Exams</title>

    <p>Please see the calendar for the exam dates.</p>

        <li>
            <title>Exam 1 (10<percent/>)</title>
            <p>This exam is meant to introduce you to the format of exams in this class and check that you have been learning the basics form early in chapter 1. Questions will be representative of material from sections 1.1<ndash/>1.3.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>Exam 2 (15<percent/>)</title>
            <p>Covers sections 1.1<ndash/>1.5 and 3.1. You will also be asked to use your graphing calculator to find zeros, local maxima, local minima, range, and intervals of increase/decrease for a function.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>Exam 3 (20<percent/>)</title>
            <p>Several Exam 1 and 2 questions will be repeated. Covers sections 3.1, 3.4, 3.5, and 4.1. You will also be asked to plot the graph of a polynomial function by hand.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>Exam 4 (25<percent/>)</title>
            <p>Several Exam 1, 2, and 3 questions will be repeated. Covers sections 4.2<ndash/>4.8. You will also be asked to plot the graphs of a rational, exponential, and logarithmic functions by hand.</p>
        </li>
    </dl>

    <p>Almost all of the points on each exam will come from exercise questions that are very close or identical to web homework exercises. This is why it is so important to be practicing with the assigned homework.  Also there will be questions that involve demonstrating your ability to create graphs by hand and use features of your graphing calculator. Some written assignments and in-class time will prepare you for these things. So if you do not complete written assignments and/or miss class, you will be unprepared.</p>

        <title>Missing an Exam</title>
        <p>If you miss an exam, you must contact me within one day to explain why or I might not be able to allow a make-up and you would receive a zero. <alert>Make-up exams are only permitted under extreme circumstances. PCC does not have enough staff and facilities to administer too many make-up exams.</alert> If you have a valid excuse, you must make it up within the next two business days, or I might not be able to allow a make-up and you would receive a zero.  If you are going to make up the exam, contact the testing center immediately (<url href="http://www.pcc.edu/resources/testing/proctored/"/>) to learn what time you might be able to make up the exam.  If you are going to miss the final exam, contact me before the test is given. Since make-up testing is occasionally abused, if you require a make-up test for more than two exams, your scores on all make-up exams will be reduced by 10 percentage points.</p> 
        <p>Above all else, <alert>get in contact with me if you have missed or will miss an exam.</alert> Space and time to make up an exam is limited. You need to make arrangements as soon as there is an issue.</p>

        <title>Accommodated Testing</title>
        <p>Students who experience disability-related barriers should contact Disability Services: <url href="www.pcc.edu/disability"/>.  If students elect to use approved academic adjustments, they must provide, in advance, formal notification from Disability Services to the instructor. Exam accommodations may include, but are not limited to, extended time and a distraction-free environment.</p>
