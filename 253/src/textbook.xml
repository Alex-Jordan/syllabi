  <title>Textbook</title>

  <p>
    <pubtitle>Calculus: Volume 2<mdash/>Math 253 and 254 by James Stewart</pubtitle>. Its ISBN is 978-1-337-06577-1.
    There are many calculus textbooks by James Stewart.
    If you have one of these, you may bring it to me and I can tell you if it will be acceptable for this course.

  <p>
    Having unrestricted access to a textbook is a requirement.
    You may own a copy or borrow one from a friend for the term.
    Used copies are fine and are often less expensive when bought online.
    Earlier editions of the same book may be acceptable.
    However you must understand that exercises usually change from one edition to the next,
    and sometimes the chapters change content or order.
    If you have an older edition, contact me to discuss if it will be acceptable.
