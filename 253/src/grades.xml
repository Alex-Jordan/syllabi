  <p>
    General PCC Grading Guidelines are found at
    <url href="http://catalog.pcc.edu/handbook/g301-gradingguidelines/">catalog.pcc.edu/handbook/g301-gradingguidelines</url>.

  <paragraphs>
    <title>Attendance/Participation</title>
    <p>
      Each day of class that you attend is worth 0.25% of your grade, up to a maximum of 4%.
      This does not include holidays, inservice days, or days where the entire class period is devoted to an exam.
      Typically in a term this leaves at least one absence that would not have a direct effect on your grade.
      However missing class will hurt your chances for success on exams
      because you will not get the same attention that your classmates had.

    <title>Web Assignments</title>
    <p>
      Most of your homework for this class is to be submitted online through the free program <webwork/>.
      For details, see <xref ref="section-webwork" text="title"/>.
      Collectively, all web assignments are worth <quantity><mag>10</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> of your final grade.
      For every web assignment that you do not submit (or have a poor score for),
      I will replace that score with the score you get on your next exam.
    </p>
  </paragraphs> -->

  <paragraphs>
    <title>Written Assignments</title>
    <p>
      Selections of problems from the textbook will be assigned to be be written up formally.
      Each written assignment is worth 3% of your grade for a total of 27%.
      See <xref ref="section-written-assignments" text="title"/> for the details.
    </p>

  <paragraphs>
    <title>Late Homework</title>
    <!-- <p>
      Web assignments are due whenever <webwork/> says they are due for full credit.
      There is no way to get credit for a late web assignment.
      After the due date, you may still do the exercises and check your work, but doing so will not increase your score.
      After the due date, full walk-through solutions are available for problems if you re-visit the problem.
      A reminder: any <webwork/> score can be overwritten by your next exam score, if that is to your benefit.
    </p> -->

    <p>
      Written assignments that are received late may receive a zero.
      If I have already graded the stack of everyone else's papers, then I may not have time to go back and grade any more.
      You may try to turn in something late, and if I have not yet graded everyone else's, then I can grade yours.
    </p>

    <title>Presentations</title>
    <p>
      You will be assigned a partner (or two), and on Wednesday November 13,
      each group will give a roughly 20-minute presentation on some topic related to sequences and series.
      These presentations are worth 9% of your grade.
      See <xref ref="section-presentations" text="title"/> for the details.

      and <xref ref="section-exams" text="title"/> for details about what is covered on each exam.
      Exams 1, 2, and 3 are each worth 20% of your grade.
