  <title>Technology Requirements</title>

  <p>
    Part of this course involves teaching you how to use certain calculus tools on a graphing calculator such as a TI-89 or Casio Classpad.
    You are <alert>required</alert> to have one and bring it to class everyday.
    The particular syntax used by these calculators is not important in the grand scheme,
    but you will need to use <em>something</em> during exams that is not connected to the internet.
    We know these calculators are capable of doing what is needed.
