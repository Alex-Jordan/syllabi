    <title>Exams</title>

    <p>Please see the <xref ref="section-calendar" autoname="title"/> for the exam dates.</p>
    <p>Almost all of the points on each exam will come from exercise questions that are very close or identical to homework exercises. This is just one more reason why it is so important to be practicing with the assigned homework.</p>

    <p><dl>
        <li xml:id="exam1">
            <title>Exam 1 (12<percent/>)</title>
            <p>Covers sections 9.2<ndash/>9.5. (It corresponds to all homework that is due prior to the exam day.)</p>
            <p>You will have the last 70 minutes of class time.</p>
            <p>As you turn in your exam, you may designate one question that you think you had the most trouble with. You may take that question home with you, solve it, and turn in your response the next class period to replace your original score for that question.</p>
        </li>
        <li xml:id="exam2">
            <title>Exam 2 (17<percent/>)</title>
            <p>Covers sections 10.1<ndash />10.6, 11.1, and 11.2. (It corresponds to all homework that is due prior to the exam day.) Additionally there may be some repeated questions from Exam 1.</p>
            <p>You will have the entire 140 minutes of class time.</p>
            <p>As you turn in your exam, you may designate one question that you think you had the most trouble with. You may take that question home with you, solve it, and turn in your response the next class period to replace your original score for that question.</p>

            <p>You will have the entire 140 minutes of class time.</p>
            <p>As you turn in your exam, you may designate one question that you think you had the most trouble with. You may take that question home with you, solve it, and turn in your response the next class period to replace your original score for that question.</p>

            <p>You will have the entire 120 minutes of allotted final exam time (which goes from 8:00<ndash />10:00).</p>
            <p>Unlike the previous exams, there is no opportunity to make up one question.</p>

        <title>Missing an Exam</title>
        <p>If you miss an exam, you must contact me within one day to explain why or I might not be able to allow a make-up and you would receive a zero. <alert>Make-up exams are only permitted under extreme circumstances. PCC does not have enough staff and facilities to administer too many make-up exams.</alert> If you have a valid excuse, you must make it up within the next two business days, or I might not be able to allow a make-up and you would receive a zero.  If you are going to make up the exam, contact the testing center immediately (<url href="http://www.pcc.edu/resources/testing/proctored/">www.pcc.edu/resources/testing/proctored</url>) to learn what time you might be able to make up the exam.  If you are going to miss the final exam, contact me before the test is given. Since make-up testing is occasionally abused, if you require a make-up test for more than two exams, your scores on all make-up exams will be reduced by 10 percentage points.</p> 
        <p>Above all else, <alert>get in contact with me if you have missed or will miss an exam.</alert> Space and time to make up an exam is limited. You need to make arrangements as soon as there is an issue.</p>
