    <p>Part of this course involves teaching you how to use certain calculus tools on a graphing calculator such as a TI-84, TI-89 or Casio Classpad. You are <alert>required</alert> to have one and bring it to class everyday.</p>

    <p>You will also need Internet access for most of your homework. If you do not have Internet access at home, you can find it in PCC computer labs.</p>

    <p>Here are some Sage cells where you can do certain things that you cannot do so easily with a graphing calculator.</p>

    <sage>
        <input>
        	var('x,y')
        	plot3d(sin(x)+cos(x+y),(x,-3,3),(y,-3,3))
        </input>
    </sage>

    <sage>
        <input>
            var('t')
            parametric_plot3d([cos(t), sin(t), t],(t,-3,3))
        </input>
    </sage>

    <sage>
        <input>
            var('u,v')
            parametric_plot3d([v*cos(u), v*sin(u), cos(v)],(u,0,2*pi),(v,0,pi))
        </input>
    </sage>

    <sage>
        <input>
            var('x,y,z')
            implicit_plot3d(x^2+z^2==exp(-2*y),(x,-3,3),(y,-3,3),(z,-3,3))
        </input>
    </sage>
