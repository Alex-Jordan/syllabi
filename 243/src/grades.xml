    <title>Attendance</title>
    <p>
      It is important for success in the course to participate with in-class discussion.
      And yet during the pandemic, it can be difficult or impossible to attend everyday,
      especially for those of us with child care concerns or unpredictable work schedules.
    </p>

    <p>
      To help motivate attendance when possible, attendance each live class session is worth 0.25% of your final grade,
      up to a total of 4.25%.
    </p>

    <p>
      And if you miss the live session, simply watch the entire class recording when you are able to,
      and then send me an email confirming that you watched it.
      I will count that for the 0.25% of the grade.
    </p>

    <title>Discussion Posts</title>
    <p>
      There are three discussion posts in D2L where your participation is required for 1.25% of your grade (each).

    <title>Written Homework</title>
    <p>
      Most weeks there is written homework, due by the end of the day on the following Thursday.
      Turn this in using D2L.
      The purpose of these assignments is to let me give feedback on:
      <ul>
        <li>your process for solving problems</li>
        <li>elements of how you explain your work to others</li>
        <li>graphical objects you will create that cannot be automatically assessed by a computer</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      One score will be assigned for each written assignment.
      Each written assignment is worth 3% of your final grade, for a total of 24%.

    <title>Optional Class Prep Assignments</title>
    <p>
      This is an opportunity to reduce the weight of the exams down to just 21%, 21%, and 22%,
      padding your grade with some work that is easy to do if you budget time for it.
      At the same time, it wil get you to engage more fully with the material and it should ultimately
      help you do better on the exams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each class day, you could come to class having <em>already</em> watched the video lessons for the day's section.
      As you watch the videos, there are video lecture notes that you could complete.
      Bringing these notes to me on the class day counts as proof that you watch the videos and engaged with them.
      For each section, I will record that you watched the videos and took notes, which credits you with 0.5% toward your grade,
      reducing the corresponding exam weight by 0.5%.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you miss class, you may scan/photo your work and send it to me electronically before the end of the day it is due.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may find the videos and the video lecture notes on the <xref ref="section-calendar" text="title"/>.
      In class on the first day, we will discuss more how this works.
