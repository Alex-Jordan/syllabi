  <title>Textbook</title>

  <p>
    We are using a <em>free</em> textbook written by David Diez, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, Leah Dorazio, and Christopher D Barr.
    The book is called <pubtitle>Advanced High School Statistics</pubtitle>.
    (The authors originally wrote it for high school AP statistics courses,
    and chose this unfortunate name that might suggest it is not college level content.
    But it really is standard college level statistics.)
