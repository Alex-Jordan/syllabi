  <title>Exams</title>

  <p>
    There will be exams on April 22, May 27, and June 8.
    Each exam will be released on the indicated day, and be <q>take-home</q>, due 24 hours later.
    I will be available vis Zoom for questions, but you will do the work outside of the synchronous class.
    The synchronous class these days will be for review and questions you may have,
    and the exams will be released when that is concluded.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first two exams are each worth 15% of your final grade. The final exam is worth 20% of your final grade.

      Please see the <xref ref="section-calendar" text="title"/> for the exam dates.

    <p>
      About a week before each exam, you will receive a practice exam.
      Practice exams are typically longer than the real exam to give you more to practice with.

    <title>Missing an Exam</title>
    <p>
      If you miss an exam, you must contact me within one day to explain why
      or I might not be able to allow a make-up and you would receive a zero.
      <alert>Make-up exams are only permitted under extreme circumstances.
      PCC does not have enough staff and facilities to administer too many make-up exams.</alert>
      If you have a valid excuse, you must make up the exam within the next two business days,
      or I might not be able to allow a make-up and you would receive a zero.
      If you are going to make up the exam, contact the testing center immediately
      (<url href="http://www.pcc.edu/resources/testing/proctored/">www.pcc.edu/resources/testing/proctored</url>)
      to learn what time you might be able to make up the exam.
      If you are going to miss the final exam, contact me before the test is given.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above all else, <alert>get in contact with me if you have missed or will miss an exam.</alert>
      Space and time to make up an exam is limited. You need to make arrangements as soon as there is an issue.

      These opportunities will be discussed in class if and when they arise.

      If students elect to use approved academic adjustments, they must provide, in advance,
